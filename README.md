# DS7333 Project Folder
This folder contains selected projects from the DS 7333: Quantifying the World class. 

## Course Description
Quantifying the World (QTW) is designed to cover multiple machine learning and
statistical methods primarily in two-week chunks. There will be approximately 90
minutes of background material and 90 minutes of live instruction per week. There will
be a case study utilizing the methods learned due every two weeks. The topics included
in this course are supervised and unsupervised methods of learning, linear and
nonlinear classifiers, and model selection and hyperparameter tuning. The overall goal
of the course is to put all of the pieces of data science learning in the MSDS program
together and build best practices for developing statistical models.
